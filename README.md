<h1>LLMNR Poisoning and Mitigation</h1>



<h2>Description</h2>
Link-Local Multicast Name Resolution (LLMNR) is a protocol used in the Domain Name System (DNS) to resolve the NetBIOS names of neighboring computers. It operates in a local network environment and is primarily intended as a fallback mechanism when the standard DNS resolution fails.

However, LLMNR has vulnerabilities that can be exploited by malicious actors for various attacks, one of which is LLMNR poisoning. LLMNR poisoning occurs when an attacker intercepts LLMNR queries and responds with spoofed information, redirecting legitimate traffic to malicious destinations. This can lead to various security risks, including man-in-the-middle attacks, credential theft, and unauthorized access to sensitive information.
  
By understanding the vulnerabilities associated with LLMNR and implementing appropriate mitigation strategies, organizations can enhance the security posture of their networks and protect against potential attacks targeting this protocol.
